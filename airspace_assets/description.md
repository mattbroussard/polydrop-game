# Simple and addicting game of catch

Use your hands to try to catch the falling shapes. Hold onto the shapes long enough, and they'll disappear, earning you points. As you earn points, you'll level up and get more difficult shapes that drop more frequently. But if shapes fall off the platform, you'll lose points and health...and if you run out of health, it's game over! How long can you keep it up?

## Features

* Play with one or two hands
